 1. QUICK-SCOPE                                               *qs-quick-scope*
==============================================================================

This plugin highlights the optimal characters to target for the |f|, |F|, |t|
and |T| motions for easier and faster left-right movement in Vim.

If you don't routinely use these keys you should! See `:help` |f| and `:help`
|;| to get started and |qs-motivation| for a detailed look at why these keys
are so useful.

In practice, this plugin should help you get to any word on a line in two or
three keystrokes with built-in Vim commands.

 2. USAGE                                                           *qs-usage*
==============================================================================

If you're viewing this file in Vim and have quick-scope installed, you should
already have good idea of what it does.

Otherwise, see https://github.com/bradford-smith94/quick-scope#Features for
screencaps of this plugin in action.

 2.1 EXAMPLE                                                      *qs-example*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Place your cursor at the beginning the line below:
>
  It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.

You should see at least one highlighted character in all but one 'word'.

A character is highlighted with a |primary-color|/|secondary-color| if it is
the first/second occurrence of that character from your cursor on a line.

Use |f|<char> or |F|<char> to jump directly to any character with a primary
highlight forward or backward.

The `h` in `the` should be the only character with a secondary highlight if
your cursor is at the beginning of the example. Use |fh;| to quickly move to
it.

 3. FEATURES                                                     *qs-features*
==============================================================================

- Quick-scope highlights the first occurrences of characters to the left and
  right of your cursor, once per word, everytime your cursor moves.

- If a word does not contain a first occurrence of a character but contains a
  second occurrence of a character, that character is highlighted in another
  color.

- Quick-scope takes extra measures to avoid bombarding you with superfluous
  colors:

  - It ignores special characters since they are easy to eye and tend to only
    appear once or twice on a line.

  - By default, it samples colors from your active color scheme for its
    highlighting.

 4. OPTIONS                                                       *qs-options*
==============================================================================

 4.1 HIGHLIGHT ON KEY PRESS                        *qs-highlight-on-key-press*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      *g:qs_highlight_on_keys*
Trigger a highlight in the appropriate direction when pressing these keys:
>
  let g:qs_highlight_on_keys = ['f', 'F', 't', 'T']
<
Trigger a highlight only when pressing |f| and |F|.
>
  let g:qs_highlight_on_keys = ['f', 'F']
<
 4.2 CUSTOMIZE COLORS                                    *qs-customize-colors*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               *primary-color*
To set the (primary) color for the first occurrence of a character simply
define the highlight group `QuickScopePrimary`.

>
  highlight QuickScopePrimary guifg='#afff5f' gui=underline ctermfg=155 cterm=underline
<
                                                             *secondary-color*
To set the (secondary) color for the second occurrence of a character simply
define the highlight group `QuickScopeSecondary`.

>
  highlight QuickScopeSecondary guifg='#5fffff' gui=underline ctermfg=81 cterm=underline
<

It is recommended to put these in an |autocmd| so that they are updated when
the colorscheme updates.

>
  autocmd ColorScheme * highlight QuickScopePrimary guifg='#afff5f' gui=underline ctermfg=155 cterm=underline
<
 4.3 TOGGLE HIGHLIGHTING                              *qs-toggle-highlighting*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           *:QuickScopeToggle*
Turn highlight on or off with a user command:
>
  :QuickScopeToggle
<
                                                    *<plug>(QuickScopeToggle)*
Create a custom mapping (<leader> + q in the example below):
>
  nmap <leader>q <plug>(QuickScopeToggle)
  vmap <leader>q <plug>(QuickScopeToggle)
<
Notice that you must use 'nmap'/'vmap' instead of 'nnoremap'/'vnoremap'.

 5. MOTIVATION                                                 *qs-motivation*
==============================================================================

In the link below is a detailed look at the most common and useful options for
moving your cursor across a line in Vim:

When you are aware of the existing tools available to you and their tradeoffs,
you can better understand the benefits of this plugin.

 6. BUGS                                                             *qs-bugs*
==============================================================================

Post any bug or feature request here:

 6.1 KNOWN BUGS                                                *qs-known-bugs*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Indenting with |<<| or |>>| throws off the highlights.

- The primary highlighting function can be very slow and is called everytime
  the cursor moves.

  Let me know if this plugin slows down Vim to an unmanageable level. Using
  |:QuickScopeToggle|, make sure that it is actually this plugin that is
  causing performance problems you are experiencing.
